GAUNTLET introduces a new gameplay mode to Armored Core VI. The player can now undertake trials in various locales across Rubicon, facing down waves of enemies, gaining the opportunity to scavenge parts and to accrue COAM.

- Gauntlet: The Wall
- Gauntlet: Xylem, the Floating City
- Gauntlet: Watchpoint Alpha

You can tweak two options within trials:
- Target Markers: enabling them will display the red target markers on all enemies helping you find them.
- Harde Mode:

Each gauntlet map follows the basic premise of a wave survival gamemode, but the exact configuration will differ per map.

All gauntlets allow the player to scavenge random parts as they kill enemies. The chance of an enemy dropping a part is based on their 'toughness', e.g. basic MTs have a 2% chance to drop a part, whereas a EKDROMOI has a 25% chance to drop a part.

Bosses will always drop a part, plus any unique loot associated with the boss.

Face up to fifteen waves of enemies, with three bosses on every fifth wave.
There are five Supply Sherpas available during the trial.
Each boss wave will reward you with a specific amount of COAM:
- 5th wave: +100,000
- 10th wave: +200,000
- 15th wave: +300,000

Completing the gauntlet will grant you an unique Head part.

The gauntlets re-purpose the training maps, so you cannot access the training missions with this mod installed.

# EMEVD / ESD events
InitializeEsdTriggeredEvent is used to setup a common_func/mXX_XX_XX_XX event that is ONLY initalized upon a ScheduleCommonEmevdEvent or ScheduleEmevdEvent command from within a ESD script.

# Template Remnants
A lot of the initialization events appear to be pointless, this is likely a remnant of a templating system where all of the stubs are added.
